ACTIVITYRECOGNITION LIBRARY COMMERCIAL LICENSE FOR OEMS, ISVS AND VARS

SLASH IDEA S.R.O. PROVIDES ITS ACTIVITYRECOGNITION LIBRARY UNDER A DUAL LICENSE MODEL DESIGNED TO MEET THE DEVELOPMENT 
and distribution needs of both commercial distributors (such as OEMs, ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.

FOR OEMS, ISVS, VARS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTORS OF COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:
OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other 
distributors that combine and distribute commercially licensed software with ActivityRecognition Library software and do not wish to distribute
the source code for the commercially licensed software under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL") must enter 
into a commercial license agreement with Slash Idea s.r.o. In such case please contact Slash Idea s.r.o. at contact@slashidea.com.

FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS AND OTHER DEVELOPERS OF OPEN SOURCE APPLICATIONS:
For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL that want to combine and distribute those 
FOSS applications with ActivityRecognition Library software, Slash Idea's ActivityRecognition Library open source software licensed under the GPL is the best option.

For developers and distributors of open source software under a FOSS license other than the GPL, Slash Idea s.r.o. makes its 
GPL-licensed ActivityRecognition Library available under a FOSS Exception that enables use of the this ActivityRecognition 
Library under certain conditions without causing the entire derivative work to be subject to the GPL.
